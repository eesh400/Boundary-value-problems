# Boundary-value-problems
This is a project which shows how to solve simple boundary value problems in differential equations in Wolfram Language(Mathematica).
1. Overview
   This project contains solutions of simple boundary value problems(BVPs) for ordinary differential equations implemented using Wolfram Language/Wolfram Mathematica.
2. Mathematical Formulation
   The problems considered are simple first and second-order ODEs of the form:
   y'(x)=f(x,y), x \in A
